## Instructions

In a machine with Java Development Kit intalled:

To compile, run the following command from "Unblock Me Ai" directory:

```sh
sh compile.sh
```

To run, execute the following command from "Unblock Me Ai" directory:

```sh
sh run.sh
```

### Choose what level you want to solve

'#' = The board's edge
'T' = The board's exit space
'.' = Empty space
'X' = The main piece (objective piece)
Other letters = Other pieces

### Choose the algorithm you want to use to solve the problem

If the algorithm requires it, choose the maximum depth of the search graph

### After this you will be presented with the best solution found

- Detailing every move of the solution step by step
- The number of vertexes created along the way
- The number of vertexes analysed
- The time it took to achieve the solution
